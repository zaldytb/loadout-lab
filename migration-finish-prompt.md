# 16X19 (Tennis Loadout Lab) - Final TypeScript Migration Prompt

**Objective:** Cross the finish line by completely eliminating the `app.js` monolith. The frontend must run exclusively on our Vite + TypeScript bridge (`src/main.js`). 

## Context & Rules
- The project is currently a hybrid. `src/main.js` handles routing, but still imports `app.js` to blindly loop through and expose its contents to `window.*` for inline HTML handlers.
- **Rule 1:** All runtime logic MUST be strongly typed in TypeScript.
- **Rule 2:** After edits, you MUST verify using `npm run typecheck && npm run canary && npm run build`. If it fails, fix the types before proceeding.
- **Rule 3:** The `window.*` bridge in `src/main.js` must be explicitly populated. We are removing the automatic `Object.entries(App)` loop. All inline `<button onclick="...">` handlers in `index.html` rely on this bridge.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Extract Remaining Orphaned Logic
Search `app.js` for the following isolated functional blocks and migrate them to their appropriate TS modules. Ensure type safety:
1. `setHybridMode` -> Move to `src/ui/shared/helpers.ts` or `src/ui/components/dock-renderers.ts`.
2. `hydrateDock` -> Move to `src/ui/components/dock-renderers.ts`.
3. `toggleTheme` -> Move to `src/ui/theme.ts` (create the file if it doesn't exist).
4. `renderComparisonPresets` -> Move to `src/ui/shared/presets.ts`.
5. `_initLandingSearch` & `_handleSharedBuildURL` -> Move to `src/ui/pages/shell.ts` or `src/main.js`.

### Step 2: Refactor `src/ui/pages/shell.ts` Dependencies
Right now, `src/ui/pages/shell.ts` imports several things from `../../../app.js`. 
- Redirect all these imports to point at your newly migrated TS exports in `src/ui/`.
- Ensure zero imports reference `app.js` in `shell.ts`.

### Step 3: Dismantle the `app.js` Bridge Loop
Open `src/main.js` and look for:
`import * as App from '../app.js';`
and the loop:
`Object.entries(App).forEach(...)`

- Provide an explicit mapping for any core functions that the loop was catching but aren't currently bound in the file. (e.g., `window.toggleTheme = Theme.toggleTheme;`). 
- Delete the `App` import and the loop entirely.

### Step 4: Delete the Monolith
Once `src/main.js` no longer depends on `app.js`, and `shell.ts` no longer imports from it, physically delete `app.js` from the repository root:
`rm app.js`

### Step 5: Verification & Safety
Run the validation gate locally:
`npm run typecheck && npm run canary && npm run build`

If compilation passes, manually check `index.html` in the dev server:
- Click the dark mode toggle (tests `toggleTheme`).
- Toggle a full-bed vs hybrid setup (tests `setHybridMode`).
- Load an active loadout (tests `hydrateDock`).
