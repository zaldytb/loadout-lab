// COMBINED PREDICTION: Frame Base + String Modifier + Tension + String Profile
// ============================================
// Frame-driven stats (spin, power, control, feel, comfort) use FW/SW weighted blend
// + L2 string mod + tension mod.
// Launch uses frame base + L2 mod + tension mod (no string profile blend).
// Stability & forgiveness are frame-only (no string or tension influence).
// Durability is string-only. Playability is string + tension.

// ============================================
// When two different strings are paired as mains/crosses, their interaction
// changes which string dominates feel, spin, power, and how fast the bed dies.
// This layer models the pairing dynamics beyond simple weighted blending.
//
// Key principles:
// - Mains dominate power, feel, spin window (longer, deform more)
// - Crosses modulate: control, launch, snapback friction, comfort, durability
// - "Which hybrid is better" depends on what job the cross is doing
// - Same cross, different main → different job → different fitness

  // Description
  const descriptions = {
    'Precision Topspin Blade': `Elite spin combined with surgical control and low power assist — you generate all the pace, the setup generates all the placement. A scalpel for topspin artists who shape every ball.`,
    'Surgical Topspin Machine': `High spin potential meets solid control. Excels at constructing points with heavy topspin from the baseline, allowing you to hit with margin and still redirect at will.`,
    'Topspin Howitzer': `Massive topspin wrapped in a power platform. The ball launches with heavy rotation AND depth — opponents get pushed behind the baseline by a ball that kicks up and keeps coming.`,
    'Power Spin Hybrid': `Power-forward with spin enhancement. The gut mains provide natural power and feel while the frame and pattern add topspin capability. A dual-threat that hits deep with dip — opponents feel both the pace and the kick.`,
    'Spin Dominator': `Spin-first setup that generates heavy ball rotation. The string bed grips the ball aggressively, creating a high-bouncing, dipping trajectory that pushes opponents behind the baseline.`,
    'Power Brawler': `Maximum power with enough raw muscle to overpower opponents. Best for players who want to dictate with pace and don't need surgical precision on every shot.`,
    'Power Hybrid': `Balanced power delivery with enough control to keep balls in play. Good for intermediate to advanced players transitioning to more aggressive play.`,
    'Precision Instrument': `Control-first build for players who generate their own pace. Every swing gives clear feedback and directional precision. Rewards clean technique with surgical accuracy.`,
    'Control Platform': `Reliable control with enough assistance to stay competitive. A stable platform for developing players or all-courters who value consistency.`,
    'Comfort Cannon': `Arm-friendly power. High comfort rating means you can swing freely without worrying about elbow or shoulder strain, while still getting good power return.`,
    'Touch Artist': `Maximum feel and connection to the ball. Ideal for net players and all-courters who rely on touch, placement, and variety over raw power.`,
    'Wall of Stability': `Immovable on contact. High stability means the frame doesn't twist on off-center hits, giving you confidence even when you're not hitting the sweet spot.`,
    'Forgiving Weapon': `Large effective sweet spot with decent power. Mis-hits still go in, and centered hits carry real authority. Good for developing power hitters.`,
    'Whip Master': `Exceptional racquet-head speed potential meets high spin capability. The light, maneuverable frame lets you generate steep swing paths and aggressive topspin without fighting the racquet. Rewards athletic, wristy players who shape the ball with racquet acceleration rather than mass.`,
    'Speed Demon': `Lightning-fast swing speed from an ultra-maneuverable platform. The frame practically disappears in the hand, letting you rip through contact zones with minimal effort. Trade-off: less stability on off-center hits, but the speed makes up for it with aggressive shot-making.`,
    'Endurance Build': `Exceptional playability duration. This setup maintains its performance characteristics far longer than average, meaning fewer restrings and more consistent play.`,
    'Marathon Setup': `Built to last. Both durability and playability are elite — the string bed stays lively for weeks and resists breakage. Ideal for frequent players.`,
    'Balanced Setup': `Well-rounded profile with no glaring weaknesses. A versatile setup that adapts to different game styles and court conditions.`
