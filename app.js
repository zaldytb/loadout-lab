    'Precision Topspin Blade': `Elite spin combined with surgical control and low power assist — you generate all the pace, the setup generates all the placement. A scalpel for topspin artists who shape every ball.`,
    'Surgical Topspin Machine': `High spin potential meets solid control. Excels at constructing points with heavy topspin from the baseline, allowing you to hit with margin and still redirect at will.`,
    'Topspin Howitzer': `Massive topspin wrapped in a power platform. The ball launches with heavy rotation AND depth — opponents get pushed behind the baseline by a ball that kicks up and keeps coming.`,
    'Power Spin Hybrid': `Power-forward with spin enhancement. The gut mains provide natural power and feel while the frame and pattern add topspin capability. A dual-threat that hits deep with dip — opponents feel both the pace and the kick.`,
    'Spin Dominator': `Spin-first setup that generates heavy ball rotation. The string bed grips the ball aggressively, creating a high-bouncing, dipping trajectory that pushes opponents behind the baseline.`,
    'Power Brawler': `Maximum power with enough raw muscle to overpower opponents. Best for players who want to dictate with pace and don't need surgical precision on every shot.`,
    'Power Hybrid': `Balanced power delivery with enough control to keep balls in play. Good for intermediate to advanced players transitioning to more aggressive play.`,
    'Precision Instrument': `Control-first build for players who generate their own pace. Every swing gives clear feedback and directional precision. Rewards clean technique with surgical accuracy.`,
    'Control Platform': `Reliable control with enough assistance to stay competitive. A stable platform for developing players or all-courters who value consistency.`,
    'Comfort Cannon': `Arm-friendly power. High comfort rating means you can swing freely without worrying about elbow or shoulder strain, while still getting good power return.`,
    'Touch Artist': `Maximum feel and connection to the ball. Ideal for net players and all-courters who rely on touch, placement, and variety over raw power.`,
    'Wall of Stability': `Immovable on contact. High stability means the frame doesn't twist on off-center hits, giving you confidence even when you're not hitting the sweet spot.`,
    'Forgiving Weapon': `Large effective sweet spot with decent power. Mis-hits still go in, and centered hits carry real authority. Good for developing power hitters.`,
    'Endurance Build': `Exceptional playability duration. This setup maintains its performance characteristics far longer than average, meaning fewer restrings and more consistent play.`,
    'Marathon Setup': `Built to last. Both durability and playability are elite — the string bed stays lively for weeks and resists breakage. Ideal for frequent players.`,
    'Balanced Setup': `Well-rounded profile with no glaring weaknesses. A versatile setup that adapts to different game styles and court conditions.`
